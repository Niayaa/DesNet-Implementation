This project is used for implementation of DenseNet on utilizing EL imaging, a non-destructive testing
method that provides high-resolution images of photovoltaic
cells. EL imaging works by applying an electric current to a
solar module so that it emits light that can be captured by
a digital camera (EL emission). This imaging technique is
sensitive to defects that are not normally visible, so it becomes
a great tool for image identification task

The dataset to be used in the group project is the ELPV dataset. It contains 2,624 EL images of functional and defective PV cells with
varying degrees of degradation extracted from 44 different solar modules. All cell images are
normalized with respect to size and perspective, corrected for camera lens distortions, and
manually annotated with a defect probability (a real-valued number from 0 to 1) and the type
of solar module (monocrystalline or polycrystalline).
